Bug: Cannot serialize key "parse" in parser: Function values are not supported.

link: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19322

You can use legacy .eslintrc.js until flatcompats issue is resolved
just create this file in root
input boilerplate:
module.exports = {
extends: ["next/core-web-vitals"],
parserOptions: {
ecmaVersion: 2021,
sourceType: "module",
},
rules: {
// eslint rules you want
},
};

and start using
npm run lint should not produce any errors anymore
